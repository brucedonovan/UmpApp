## üßë‚Äçüíª Development Notes

- **Swift Package Manager** provides excellent cross-platform compatibility
- **ObservableObject** pattern ensures proper state management across iOS/watchOS
- **Platform targets** set to iOS 15.0/watchOS 8.0 for broad device compatibility
- **Haptic feedback** on Apple Watch enhances user experience
- **Comprehensive testing** ensures cricket rules are correctly implemented

## üèè Cricket Rules Summary

The app correctly implements these cricket scoring rules:
- **Dot Ball**: 0 runs, advances ball count
- **Runs (1-6)**: Scored runs, advances ball count  
- **Wide**: 1 extra run, does NOT advance ball count
- **No Ball**: 1 extra run, does NOT advance ball count
- **Bye**: Runs scored without bat contact, advances ball count
- **Leg Bye**: Runs off the body, advances ball count
- **Over Complete**: After 6 legal balls (excluding wides/no balls)

The app is ready for use in actual cricket matches! üèè

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have Xcode 16.0 or later installed
2. Open `UmpApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode

### Running on iOS Simulator
1. Select "UmpApp" scheme in Xcode
2. Choose an iOS simulator (iPhone 15 Pro recommended)
3. Press Cmd+R to build and run

### Running on Apple Watch Simulator
1. Select "UmpApp Watch App" scheme in Xcode
2. Choose a Watch simulator paired with an iOS simulator
3. Press Cmd+R to build and run

### Running on Physical Devices
1. Connect your iPhone to your Mac
2. If testing Watch app, ensure your Apple Watch is paired
3. Select your device in Xcode
4. Build and run the project

## Usage Guide

### iOS App Usage
1. **Scoring Runs**: Tap the numbered buttons (0-6) to record runs
2. **Adding Extras**:
   - Tap "Wide" or "No Ball" for immediate extras
   - Tap "Bye" or "Leg Bye" and select the number of runs
3. **Game Management**:
   - Use "Undo" to reverse the last ball
   - Use "Reset Game" to start a new game
4. **Over Tracking**: The app automatically advances overs after 6 legal balls

### Apple Watch Usage
1. **Score Tab**: View current game status and recent balls
2. **Quick Actions Tab**: 
   - Tap run buttons for immediate scoring
   - Use "Other Runs" for custom amounts
   - "Undo Last" to reverse the previous ball
3. **Extras Tab**:
   - Tap extras buttons for immediate application
   - Byes and Leg Byes open pickers for run selection
   - Reset game when needed

## Cricket Rules Implementation

The app follows standard cricket rules:
- **Legal Ball**: Any ball that is not a wide or no-ball counts toward the over
- **Extras**: Wides and no-balls add 1 run automatically and don't count as legal balls
- **Byes/Leg Byes**: Add runs but count as legal balls
- **Over Completion**: After 6 legal balls, the over advances automatically
- **Run Tracking**: All runs are accumulated in the total score

## Customization

### Changing Balls Per Over
The default is 6 balls per over (standard cricket). To modify:
1. Open `CricketGameModel.swift`
2. Change the `maxBallsPerOver` property
3. Rebuild the project

### Adding New Features
The shared `CricketGameModel` makes it easy to add new features:
1. Add properties to track new statistics
2. Add methods to handle new actions
3. Update both iOS and Watch interfaces to display new data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build Errors**: Ensure you're using Xcode 16.0+ and have the latest iOS/watchOS SDKs
2. **Watch App Not Appearing**: Make sure the Watch simulator is properly paired
3. **State Not Syncing**: The model is separate for each app - consider implementing data sharing if needed

### Development Tips
- Use SwiftUI previews for rapid UI development
- Test on both small and large screen sizes
- Verify haptic feedback is working on physical devices
- Test with VoiceOver for accessibility

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:
- Data persistence between app launches
- Match statistics and history
- Multiple match formats (T20, ODI, Test)
- Bowler and batsman tracking
- Scoring sync between iOS and Watch apps
- Export match data
- Customizable over lengths
